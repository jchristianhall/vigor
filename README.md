# Vigor

This is a project I put together for my final HCI course. Time
constraints resulted in the code being pretty rough, and some things
I wanted to implement couldn't be done in time. Maybe I'll revisit
this project in the future.

## Project Setup
This project utilizes Playbook, reference Playbook's [setup guide](https://github.com/centresource/generator-playbook#get-started).

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `bower install`
4. `bundle install`

## Usage

### Grunt Tasks
- Check, test & build for production: `grunt`
- Serve the site locally: `grunt serve`
- Deploy to production: `grunt deploy`
